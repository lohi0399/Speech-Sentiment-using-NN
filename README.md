# Speech-Sentiment-using-NN



This project leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to train models using the RAVDESS dataset, which contains labeled audio files representing basic emotions. Beyond simply predicting emotions from speech, the project also focuses on conducting analytical research by experimenting with various machine learning algorithms and neural network architectures. The final goal is to compare their performance, analyze the results, and extract meaningful insights.
